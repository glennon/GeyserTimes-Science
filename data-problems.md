**An Inventory of Geyser Observation Data Problems**  
Rationale: Illustrate common problems and create a starting point for brainstorming solutions. While some of these issues may be impractical to solve, mobile computing, data loggers, crowdsourcing and/or field observation may afford methods for improvements.

* *Missing eruptions*; many geyser eruptions are not reported, particularly at night. The dataset is only a sample of the actual geyser eruption activity.
* *Ambiguous closed intervals*; It is often ambiguous as to when an eruption has not been reported or whether a long period has occurred between eruptions.
* *Duration/discharge/height are rarely collected*; It is simple to record a geyser name and start time.
