#### Data License, Attribution, and Naming
GeyserTimes uses the [Open Source Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/). Though GeyserTimes data are open, the license has a few stipulations, including that you attribute the project and share alike. The minimum expected attribution is: `© GeyserTimes`. On digital platforms, a link from the attribution to https://geysertimes.org should be included (Example: [© GeyserTimes](https://geysertimes.org)). The proper spelling and capitalization of the project is *GeyserTimes* -- written as a single word with the *G* and *T* capitalized.


#### Scientific Citation Formatting
The following are citation examples in the APA style for a single geyser eruption, multiple days of data, multiple geysers over a multi-year time span, and a large survey of geysers over a single year. The title of the webpage should be constructed by the user to succinctly describe the data in a human-understanble format--toward enabling future readers to retrieve the data themselves.
