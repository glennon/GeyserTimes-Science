### GeyserTimes Science
This repository contains resources to support the scientific use of the [GeyserTimes](http://geysertimes.org) platform. 

* **Bug Reports and Suggestions**
If you encounter a bug in the GeyserTimes webpage or app, the best way to report it is by submitting an issue; general instructions can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). Add the label *bug* to highlight the note. Similarly, submit an issue if you have suggestions for how to improve GeyserTimes (GT). Add the label *suggestion* to highlight the issue. If using a GitHub Issue is too confusing, suggestions and comments can also be sent to: webmaster[at]geysertimes.org.

* **Data License, Attribution, and Naming** GeyserTimes uses the [Open Source Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/). Though GT data are open, the license has a few stipulations, including that you attribute the project and share alike. The requested attribution is: `Â© GeyserTimes`. On digital platforms, a link from the attribution to http://geysertimes.org is appreciated. Some data accessible via GT stems from other sources; those data are marked and reference their attribution requirements. The proper spelling and capitalization of the project is *GeyserTimes* -- written as a single word with the *G* and *T* capitalized.

* **Developer API** GT infrastructure supports some programmatic retrieval requests; [API documentation](http://geysertimes.org/api/v4/docs/index.php).  

* **Temperature Logger Data** The National Park Service and Yellowstone Volcanic Observatory data loggers are archived [here](http://geysertimes.org/datalogger/index.php). See a visualization of available logging data [here](http://geysertimes.org/datalogger/analysis/punchcard/punchcard.php).
