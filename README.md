### Data Licenses and Attribution

GeyserTimes is an "open data" project -- using the [Open Source Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/) for the database, and the [Database Content License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/index.html) for database contents. These licenses allow copying or publishing under the conditions that you attribute the project and [share alike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike). The expected attribution is: `© GeyserTimes contributors` or if space is limited, `© GeyserTimes`. On digital platforms a link from the attribution to [https://geysertimes.org](https://geysertimes.org) should be included (Example: [© GeyserTimes](https://geysertimes.org)).

### Scientific Citation Formatting

In citing for scientific publications, GeyserTimes materials have many similarities to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia). Both are online publishers of community-sourced information, and both share issues of complex  authorship and reliability. Using your publication's formatting guidelines and considerations for referencing Wikipedia is a good starting place for citing GeyserTimes. Since most journal citation formats are variations of styles defined by the American Psychological Association ([APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples/wikipedia-references)), [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html), or and Modern Language Association ([MLA](https://style.mla.org/citing-entries-in-reference-works/)) formats, their Wikipedia citation formats generally are the most appropriate templates for referencing GeyserTimes.

To aid authors in developing their citations, the following use the APA style template for a single geyser eruption, multiple days of data, and multiple geysers over a multi-year time span. Because eruptions, including single eruptions, often comprise numerous observations, you must construct a title for the citation to describe the data in a human-understandable format--toward enabling future readers to retrieve the data themselves. The standard recommended title is: Eruption(s) of (Geyser name(s)), (date(s))(time(s)). You should check your self-created title against the GeyserTimes [Retrieve page](https://geysertimes.org/retrieve.php) to determine whether your description would enable subsequent scientists and readers to find your referenced, relevant eruptions. We discourage the use of the specific Eruption # that appears in some web and mobile clients as that number is not searchable by other researchers and may not be supported by some implementations of the database.

*   `Eruption of (Geyser Name), (Date), (Time). (Year and date retrieved from GeyserTimes). In _GeyserTimes_. https://geysertimes.org.`
*   `Eruption of Old Faithful Geyser, June 2, 2020, 12:02. (2020, June 7). In _GeyserTimes_. https://geysertimes.org.`
*   `Eruptions of Old Faithful Geyser, May 1-3, 2017. (2020, June 7). In _GeyserTimes_. https://geysertimes.org.`
*   `Eruptions of Beehive, Grand, and Lion Geysers, 2010-2012. (2020, June 7). In _GeyserTimes_. https://geysertimes.org.`

When a single or small number of observers recorded all of a study's relevant data via GeyserTimes, authors are encouraged to use those individuals' names in the citation. Single-sourced observation notes should be referenced similarly. However, be cautious about referencing single-sourced narrative notes. While crowdsourced policing mechanisms exist for geyser eruptions--that is, unusual observations commonly are scrutinized, notes often cannot be corroborated. To cite single-sourced, small-group-sourced eruptions, or notes, the following examples in the [APA](https://apaformat.org/apa-encyclopedia-citation/) style for an online encyclopedia article are offered as starting templates. Again, the title of the article must be created by you, the author referencing the eruptions.

*   `Lassetter, B. (2020) Eruptions of Pink Cone Geyser, September 15-16, 2019. In _GeyserTimes_. Retrieved from https://geysertimes.org.`
*   `Stoumbos, D. (2020) Note about Comet Geyser, June 6, 2020, 16:07-16:09. In _GeyserTimes_. Retrieved from https://geysertimes.org.`

Including GeyserTimes in your acknowledgement sections is always appreciated; e.g, "Geyser data were provided by GeyserTimes.org".
