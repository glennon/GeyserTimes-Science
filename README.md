### Data License, Attribution, and Naming

GeyserTimes is an "open data" project -- using the [Open Source Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/) for the database, and the [Database Content License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/index.html) for database contents. These licenses allow copying or publishing under the conditions that you attribute the project and [share alike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike). The expected attribution is: `© GeyserTimes Contributors` or if space is limited, `© GeyserTimes`. On digital platforms, a link from the attribution to [https://geysertimes.org](https://geysertimes.org) should be included (Example: [© GeyserTimes](https://geysertimes.org)). The proper spelling and capitalization of the project is _GeyserTimes_ -- written as a single word with the _G_ and _T_ capitalized.

### Scientific Citation Formatting

As a dataset arising from community collaboration, GeyserTimes recommends using citation styles by [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples/wikipedia-references) or [MLA](https://style.mla.org/citing-entries-in-reference-works/) for the similar project Wikipedia. The following are citation examples in the APA style for a single geyser eruption, multiple days of data, and multiple geysers over a multi-year time span. Because eruptions, including single eruptions, often comprise numerous observations, you must construct a title for the citation to describe the data in a human-understandable format--toward enabling future readers to retrieve the data themselves. The standard recommended title is: Eruption(s) of (Geyser name(s)), (date(s))(time(s)). You should check your self-created title against the GeyserTimes [Retrieve page](https://geysertimes.org/retrieve.php) to determine whether your description would enable subsequent scientists and readers to find your referenced, relevant eruptions. We discourage the use of the specific Eruption # that appears in some web and mobile clients as that number is not searchable by other researchers and may not be supported by some implementations of the database.

*   `Eruption of Old Faithful Geyser, June 2, 2020, 12:02\. (2020, June 7). In _GeyserTimes_. https://geysertimes.org.`

When a single observer or small number of observers recorded all of a study's relevant data via GeyserTimes, authors are encouraged to use the observer name in the citation. Single-sourced observation notes should be referenced similarly. However, be cautious about referencing single-sourced narrative notes. While crowdsourced policing mechanisms exist for geyser eruptions, notes have no similar quality control. To cite single-sourced, small-group-sourced eruptions, or notes, the [APA](https://apaformat.org/apa-encyclopedia-citation/) style for an online encyclopedia is recommended. Again, the title of the article must be created by you, the author referencing the eruptions.

Including GeyserTimes in your acknowledgement sections is always appreciated; e.g, "Geyser data were provided by GeyserTimes.org".
